1) Situation in which NUC master_discovery cannot discover zilker-hsrb master
  ### Need to follow steps of whiteboard Resources->3->Section 2.1 only
  ### After that, Follow the step by step instructions of ROS-systems.pdf
  section 3.2 READ CAREFULLY EACH STEP. Note that this document overlooks the
  ip_forwarding. After those steps do not forget the `sudo service procps
  restart`. THEN:
  - On HSR:
      - Terminal 1
        `sbws`
        `epuri`
        `rosrun master_discovery_fkie master_discovery _mcast_group:=224.0.0.1`
      - Terminal 2
        `sbws`
        `epuri`
        `rostopic echo /master_discovery/changes` ### This will tell you the
        name and uri of each ros master that HSR's copy of master_discovery
        can see ### Note this will not discover the NUC roscore until you have
        started NUC's copy of master_discovery
    - On NUC:
      - Terminal 1
        `uws`
        `epuri`
        `roscore`
      - Terminal 2
        `auws`
        `epuri`
        `rosrun master_discovery_fkie master_discovery _mcast_group:=224.0.0.1`
        ### At the time of this writing, you will see that NUC cannot discover
        the HSR Master. To double check, you can try the similar instructions
        to `rostopic echo /master_discovery/changes`


2) Once both master_discovery nodes recognize each other, we need to continue to follow the ROS-Systems.pdf
   (Note above we are following along the instructions at the beginning of
   section 3.3 of that pdf). This means we will run the master_sync. 
   - i.e. in another terminal of each computer (HSR, NUC) source and epuri as
     before, and then run `rosrun master_sync_fkie master_sync`
   - Next, we need to test that the sync is working 
    - In one computer, publish the test topic `rostopic pub -r 1 /test
      std_msgs/Int32 1` ... In the other, `rostopic list |grep "test"
    - Now, run the topic in the other computer and make sure you can see it
      from the other. 
   - Now our master sync is working and the network is properly configured


3) As just stated, the master discovery and sync are working. Now we need to
   test the launch files Ryan made. Note that this repository has an a1 branch
   and an hsr branch. The launch file
   master_sync_fkie/launch/master_sync.launch is THE ONLY DIFFERENCE between
   the two. The setup is designed with the assumption that the
   multisearch_action and all related nodes (i.e frontier_server, etc.) are
   running on the NUC. 
   - Information the NUC Master needs from HSR:
     - /dynamic_obstacle_map, a topic published by /base_path_planner
     - /global_pose_hsr, a topic published by /non_markov_localization
   - Information the HSR Master needs from NUC (i.e. needs from the
     multisearch_action) 
     - Some sort of GOAL, which is left to Minkyu to configure properly. The
       important piece here is that the multimaster setup is under the
       assumption that the the only NODE running on the NUC that the HSR needs
       access to (i.e the NODE that is publishing the GOAL topic) is the
       multisearch_action (search_service/scripts/map_manager.py)
